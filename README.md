# Data Processing ETL Project

## Overview

This project represents a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, developed as part of a Data Engineering learning journey. The project demonstrates key concepts and techniques in data handling, utilizing Python and popular data analysis libraries.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction**: The project showcases how to extract data from various sources, including CSV files, REST APIs, and SQL databases. This illustrates the flexibility required in real-world data scenarios.

- **Data Transformation**: Various techniques for processing and transforming data are demonstrated, including aggregation, filtering, and categorization. This shows how raw data can be converted into meaningful information.

- **Data Loading**: The project includes methods for storing processed data in various formats, such as CSV, JSON, and SQL databases, illustrating flexibility in data storage.

- **Modular Structure**: The code is organized into logical modules, facilitating understanding, maintenance, and expansion of the project.

## Technologies

The project utilizes several key Python libraries:
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Requests for HTTP requests to APIs
- SQLAlchemy for database interactions

## Educational Purpose

This project was created as part of a self-study in Data Engineering. It serves as a practical exercise in applying data processing concepts to a real-world scenario. The project demonstrates how different components of the ETL process work together, providing a solid foundation for further learning and development in the field of data engineering.
